# Implementation Plan: Portfolio Website with Parallax Effects

**Branch**: `[1-portfolio-parallax]` | **Date**: February 15, 2026 | **Spec**: [specs/1-portfolio-parallax/spec.md](specs/1-portfolio-parallax/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-portfolio-parallax/spec.md`

## Summary

Create a professional personal portfolio website for Oliver Cayaban (Engineer) featuring a modern design with parallax scrolling effects. The site will serve as a professional showcase for recruiters and potential clients, displaying work experience, skills, projects, and contact information with an engaging visual experience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (existing in project)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18.x, Tailwind CSS (existing), Framer Motion (for parallax/animations)  
**Storage**: Static content (no backend storage required)  
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright (existing project tooling)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (all modern browsers)  
**Project Type**: Single-page website (frontend-only)  
**Performance Goals**: 30+ FPS during scroll animations, under 5s initial load on 4G  
**Constraints**: Responsive design required, accessibility for motion sensitivity  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user (personal portfolio), ~5 content sections

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Not applicable**: This is a simple frontend-only portfolio website. The constitution template is for library/package projects and does not apply to this use case.

**Structure Decision**: Adding portfolio as main homepage at `/` replacing the existing starter template. New components organized in `components/portfolio/` folder following existing patterns.

---

## Phase 0: Research

**Status**: Not Required

No unknowns identified in Technical Context. All decisions are straightforward:
- React 18 with existing TypeScript - already in project
- Tailwind CSS for styling - already configured
- Framer Motion for parallax - standard choice, well-documented
- No backend/API needed - static portfolio

---

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Status**: Not Required

This is a static frontend-only website with no:
- Data entities requiring database storage
- API contracts for external integrations  
- Authentication or user management
- Complex data modeling needs

The feature can proceed directly to implementation tasks.

---

## Phase 2: Implementation Tasks

To be generated by `/speckit.tasks` command.

### Expected Tasks

1. Create portfolio content data file (`src/data/portfolio.ts`)
2. Create parallax hook (`src/hooks/useScrollParallax.ts`)
3. Create portfolio components (`Hero`, `About`, `Experience`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Contact`, `ParallaxContainer`)
4. Replace homepage route (`src/routes/index.tsx`)
5. Add responsive styles for all sections
6. Add prefers-reduced-motion support
7. Create Playwright tests for portfolio
8. Verify all success criteria pass

---

## Notes

- **Technology decisions**: Using Framer Motion for parallax as it's the standard React animation library and integrates well with existing project
- **Content**: Placeholder content to be provided by Oliver Cayaban (engineer name, experience, skills, projects)
- **Future considerations**: Could add blog section, case studies, or CMS integration if needed later

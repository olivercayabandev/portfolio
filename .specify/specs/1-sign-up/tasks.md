# Tasks: Sign Up Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-sign-up/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/api-contracts.md ✅

**Tests**: No automated tests specified in feature specification - manual testing required.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend-only web app**: `src/` at repository root (routes, components, hooks, api-services)
- **Routes**: `src/routes/` - TanStack Router file-based routing
- **Components**: `src/components/` and `src/components/ui/` for shadcn UI components
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/` and `src/hooks/api/` for TanStack Query hooks
- **API Services**: `src/api-services/` for external API communication
- **Utilities**: `src/lib/` for helper functions
- **Config**: `src/config/` for environment configuration

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Data Model Updates)

**Purpose**: Update TypeScript types to support firstName and lastName fields. This MUST be complete before any user story implementation.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [ ] T001 Update `SignUpRequest` interface in src/api-services/types.ts to replace `name` field with `firstName` and `lastName` fields

**Checkpoint**: Type system updated - user story implementation can now begin.

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Account Registration (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Allow new users to register accounts with email, password, first name, and last name. Implement complete sign-up form with validation, loading states, error handling, and password show/hide toggle.

**Independent Test**:

1. Navigate to /sign-up
2. Try submitting with invalid data → verify red rings and error messages appear
3. Try submitting with valid data → verify loading state, submission, and redirect to dashboard
4. Test all validation rules (email format, password length, empty fields)
5. Verify password toggle functionality

### Implementation for User Story 1

**Foundation** (depends on T001 from Phase 1):

- [ ] T002 [US1] Create zod validation schema for sign-up form in src/routes/sign-up.tsx with rules:

- [ ] T030 [US1] Test password with special characters - verify all character types allowed (Edge Case)
- [ ] T031 [US1] Test first/last name with numbers/special characters - verify allowed (Edge Case)
- [ ] T032 [US1] Test form submission with Enter key - verify form submits and validation triggers (Edge Case)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Users can register accounts with complete validation, error handling, and responsive design.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Navigation to Sign-In (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide a link from the sign-up page to the sign-in page for users who already have accounts.

**Independent Test**: Click the "Already have an account? Sign in" link and verify navigation to /sign-in page.

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 83

- Phase 1: Foundation - 1 task (T001)
- Phase 2: User Story 1 - 31 tasks (T002-T032)
- Phase 3: User Story 2 - 5 tasks (T033-T037)
- Phase 4: QA & Verification - 47 tasks (T038-T085)

**Critical Path**: T001 → T002 → T003 → T010 → T011 (core sign-up functionality)

**Parallelizable Tasks**: Tasks marked with [P] can be implemented in parallel.

**User Story Independence**:

- User Story 1 (Account Registration) - Fully independent, delivers complete sign-up functionality
- User Story 2 (Navigation to Sign-In) - Independent of US1, can be implemented after minimal US1 structure is in place

---

## Implementation Tips

### Following Design Patterns

The implementation should closely follow the existing sign-in page at `src/routes/sign-in.tsx`:

1. **Component Structure**: Mirror the overall structure - header, error display, form, navigation link
2. **Form Layout**: Use the same centered container, max-w-md, and spacing classes
3. **Validation Pattern**: Use the same FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormControl, FormMessage pattern
4. **Error Handling**: Use the same destructively-styled alert box for API errors
5. **Loading States**: Use the same pattern for button loading state and disabling inputs
6. **Icons**: Use Lucide icons (UserPlus for sign-up, Eye/EyeOff for password toggle)
7. **Link Styling**: Match the sign-in page link styling with primary color and hover underline

### Constitution Compliance

All implementation must maintain strict adherence to the constitution:

- **Clean Code Architecture**: No direct API calls, always go through useAuth hook
- **Simple UI/UX**: Use shadcn components, Tailwind utility classes, react-hook-form + zod
- **Responsive Design**: Test at all breakpoints, ensure 44x44px touch targets
- **Technology Stack**: Use TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI, TypeScript
- **Code Quality**: No `any` types, explicit imports, type-safe validation, user-friendly errors

### Testing Workflow

1. Complete Phase 1 (Type System Updates)
2. Implement enough of US1 to get basic form rendering (T003-T009)
3. Test at all breakpoints (T018-T023)
4. Complete form logic and integration (T010-T017)
5. Test all validation and edge cases (T024-T032)
6. Implement US2 (T033-T037)
7. Run final QA and verification (Phase 4)

## Notes

- **Backend Coordination**: Before implementation begins, coordinate with backend team to confirm the `/auth/signup` endpoint accepts the new `{ firstName, lastName, email, password }` payload structure
- **Email Verification**: Not required for this feature (as specified in assumptions), but may be added as a future enhancement
- **Password Confirmation**: Not required for this feature (as specified in user description), but may be added as a future enhancement
- **Analytics**: SC-003 (90% success rate) cannot be measured without analytics infrastructure - this is a future enhancement

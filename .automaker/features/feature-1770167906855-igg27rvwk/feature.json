The existing UI design and components should remain unchanged while replacing all server-side infrastructure with a centralized API service layer.\n\nRequirements:\n\nRemove Backend Infrastructure\n- Delete src/db/ directory containing schema, migrations, and configuration files\n- Remove all Drizzle ORM dependencies from package.json\n- Uninstall Better Auth and remove all authentication middleware\n- Remove S3/R2 storage infrastructure and delete upload handlers\n- Delete all server-side API routes and tRPC/router implementations\n- Clean up server middleware, server functions, and session management code\n\nImplement API Service Layer\n- Create src/api-services/ directory with organized service modules\n- Build base HTTP client with request/response interceptors for auth tokens and error handling\n- Implement service modules for each domain (auth, users, files, etc.)\n- Define TypeScript interfaces matching external API contracts\n- Add request/response transformers for data normalization\n\nRefactor Frontend Architecture\n- Convert src/routes/ to frontend-only TanStack Router routes\n- Update all components to use new API hooks instead of server functions\n- Transform src/hooks/ to use TanStack Query for external API calls\n- Replace internal authentication with external provider integration (OAuth/JWT flow)\n- Update file upload components to use presigned URLs or direct client-side uploads\n\nUpdate Configuration and Documentation\n- Remove server-specific build configuration from build tools\n- Update Vite config for frontend-only deployment\n- Remove database connection strings and server secrets from environment variables\n- Add external API base URL configuration to environment\n- Update TypeScript paths and build targets for frontend-only\n- Update docs/architecture.md to reflect the new frontend-only architecture\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n- Application builds and runs without any backend dependencies\n- All data fetching flows through the centralized API service layer\n- Users can authenticate via external provider with persistent session management\n- File upload and download operations work through external storage APIs\n- Build outputs static assets suitable for CDN deployment\n- Architecture documentation accurately describes the new frontend-only pattern",
